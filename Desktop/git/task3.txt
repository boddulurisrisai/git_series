Hello everyone,I am SriSai and I am pursuing B.Tech at KL University.
Task 3

Q1) What is meant by the term fork and clone?
Ans)->The term fork means producing a personal copy of someone else project.Git Fork means 
      you just create a copy of the main repository of a project source code to your own GitHub profile.
    ->The term clone means getting a local copy of the code present in the repository. After cloning you
      can then do whatever changes you like in the code and then you can pull the changes back to the repository.

    
Q2)What are branches in Github?
Ans)Branches are the feature used for separating a feature or part of code from  master in order 
    not to mess something in your main code.We can create,rename,update,delete branches and can 
    merge with th master branch if required.

Q3)What is PR?
Ans)PR means Pull requests in which u tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository.
     Once a pull request is sent,interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential 
     modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.


Q4)Can we delete the master branch if not Why?
Ans)Yes,we can delete the master branch using git commands first i local repository and then remote repository.
   ->First you delete master in your local clone. To do this we first make a new branch called placeholder
     or similar, and delete master from there:

     git branch placeholder
     git checkout placeholder
     git branch -D master

   ->Next we must delete the branch on github
     git push origin :master


Q5)How can we delete a branch? (Explore a bit about this yourself)
Ans)->Deleting a branch LOCALLY
      Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently on so you must make sure to checkout a branch that you are
      NOT deleting. For example: git checkout master

      git branch -d <branch>

   ->Deleting a branch REMOTELY

     git push <remote> --delete <branch>
               or
     git push <remote> :<branch>
